This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug: a stack overflow error caused by a recursive function. The `foo` function recursively calls itself, which works fine for small values of 'a'. However, for larger values, the function will eventually exceed the call stack limit, causing a stack overflow error. The solution involves using an iterative approach instead of recursion.
